# OSSSSafe

[<img width="240px" alt='Get it on Google Play' src='https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en_badge_web_generic.png'/>](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.odedniv.osafe)

Open Source Super Simple Synced Safe, or OSafe for short,
is a completely open app for safely storing your secrets,
with as little clicks as possible, backed up and accessible from anywhere.

- Ad free
- No payment whatsoever
- Encrypted file only backed up in your Google Drive (osafe.json)

## Why?

1. I don't fully trust closed source apps & services, especially with my secrets for all the other apps & services!
2. I hate that after entering my password, I still needed 5 clicks to copy my password.
3. Random generated characters stink (https://xkcd.com/936).

OSafe is a single document where you can write your secrets however you like,
and copy them the Android way. No complex buttons or anything.

Don't trust me? You shouldn't! Check the source code.

Still don't trust that the Play Store version has the same code? Build it yourself!
